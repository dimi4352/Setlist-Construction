# Notes:

All APIs need a key or an acount to access the data.

The Spotify enviroment file is copied and is not my work.

Some of the tables are missing since they were too lange.

To get access to all APIs you must get your own keys. It is illegal for me to provide my personal keys.

The Recording Stats file is not here. This is because it is essentialy all of the highl-leve AcousticBrainz database (ca. 400 GB).
It has a custom file system that I created in order to navigate it.
